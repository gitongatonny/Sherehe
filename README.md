# Sherehe - Event Planning Website.

This is a university group project that we undertook as a group of 3 for our internal attachment software module in our 3rd semester in 2nd year Computer Science at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology.

I embarked on this project with 2 of my fellow like-minded and brilliant colleagues: Moses Etyang' and Bridget Ngugi.

It's an venue booking website called Sherehe. It allows a user to check out available venue locations in Nyeri so that they can book one and host their event e.g. a wedding or graduation ceremony. The website contains a list and description of venue locations in Nyeri e.g. hotels, gardens and resorts. 

The user selects the venue of their choice and inputs the number of guests expected, the date in which they'll book the place (up to a week) and the name and type of event to be hosted. They will then proceed to pay and an invitation card will be generated, which they can send to their guests.

Some of the features are:
-> allows user to login & register
-> the admin has a separate dashboard to manage the website details e.g. venue listings
-> feedback can be submitted without the need to sign in (but you have to submit your email)
-> users can change their password
-> users can view their booking history on their profile
-> the admin can view the users' list and feedback submitted

It was an exciting journey in working to complete this project with my colleagues and we broke through the obstacles together as an incredible team.
